The document is aimed to assist third parties to integrate with the new API Service which is not only third party-agnostic but also easily integrable as a standalone service or in combination with other Docs offerings. The Global Docs Service now has a new Global Docs API Gateway which decouples Docs features from all architectural and service dependencies associated with other Fintech offerings. This can be utilized when third parties want to integrate only with Docs and not update/ Fraud services or in combination with them.
