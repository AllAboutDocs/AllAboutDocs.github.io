# Global Docs API Service Integration Guide

This is a document that I have created with sample and sanitized text content to replicate a standard API Integration Guide. The main purpose of creating this repository is to practise the various docs-as-code approaches with different static site generators and different deployment systems.

At first I intent to try a minimalistic Jekyll theme and GitHub Pages, and later I plan to explore some other options.
