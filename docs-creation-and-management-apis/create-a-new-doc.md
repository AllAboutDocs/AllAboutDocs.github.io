## Create a new Doc

This request creates a new Docs account in the Docs ecosystem and establishes a docs container for a user. A user can have one or more docs, each identified by a unique Docs ID, linked user ID, and type.
This endpoint creates a Docs object depending on whether an existing user is available. The following two scenarios are possible:

- **User does not exist** - The user will be created in this flow by providing the external user id (third party-side customer code) and then passing the `X-User-Id` value in the header during Docs creation.

- **User already exists** - The Docs is created by providing an internal user Id or owner ID.  
  Note: You **must** provide either owner ID or external ID in the request body.

- The Create Docs request object **must** contain the following:

### Query Parameters - Required\*

- `Docs-Entity-ID` - the unique identifier of the third party entity
- `X-Idempotency-Key` - the unique server-created key to confirm subsequent retries of the same request

### Request Parameters - Required\*

- `type` - the type of the Docs to be created
- `owner`
  - `id` - the unique ID of the Docs owner
- `externalId`- the unique customer code of of Docs user
