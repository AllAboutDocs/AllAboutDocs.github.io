## Add Lists through Relists/ Contents Migration

This request adds lists to an existing customer Docs account via relists or contents migrations. The Add lists request object **must** contain the following:

### Query Parameters - Required\*

- `X-Docs-ID` - the unique customer Docs account ID

- `Docs-Entity-ID` - the unique identifier of the third party entity

- `X-Idempotency-Key` - the unique server-created key to confirm subsequent retries of the same request

### Request Parameters - Required\*

- `externalId` - the unique identifier provided by the third party for each successful docs transfer. The field is going to be used to fetch lists and to map docs transfers with a unique identifier on the third party side by any reporting/ data analytics job.

- `type` - the docs type referring to whether the docs is a revert or contents migration

  - `transactionBreakdown` - detailed breakdown of the corresponding docs transfers

  - `referenceId` - the unique ID which identifies the origin of the docs update transaction. This is the initial ID associated with the relevant docs transfer and can be used for the mapping with System Service Accounts along with reconciliation.

  - `docsMethod` - the method of update, i.e. online or manual  
    **Note:** manual should be specifically mentioned for proper categorization. The third party is responsible for accurately identifying whether the source is manual or another method. There are no restrictions on the values for non-manual update methods.

  - `amount`- The amount of lists to be credited to the Docs for each update method. For instance, if a revert request involves both manual and credit online, there should be separate entries for each method with the respective amounts.

    - `type` - The type of type

    - `value` - the priority value associated with the transaction
