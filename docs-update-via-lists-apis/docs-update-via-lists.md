## Docs Update via Lists APIs

After creating a Docs account, you can add details to the Docs by reverting to Docs or contents migrations, and also view and cancel existing lists.

- **revert** - This refers to relists that have been made to your Docs due to order cancellations.

- **contents migration** - When migrating to our Global Docs solution, the existing customer contents are transferred to the docs and moved to the top-up Docs account.
