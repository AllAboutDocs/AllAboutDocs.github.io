# Docs Creation and Management APIs

The Docs represents an entity that holds all lists, accounts, and related docs movements. You need to create a Docs to initiate Docs update or outflow transactions. After creating a Docs, you can view the Docs details, update Docs status, and list Docs contents. For the Docs Management Module APIs, all processing will be done in a synchronous way:

- Create User
- Create Docs
- Get Docs
